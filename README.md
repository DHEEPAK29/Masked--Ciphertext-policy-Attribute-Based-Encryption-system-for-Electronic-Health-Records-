![13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43454a35-8a41-4339-8ab8-f88e05124368)

Developed a Blockchain based Web application that maintains sensitive Electronic Health Records (EHR) in a highly secure environment using masked Ciphertext Policy Attribute Based Encryption (CP-ABE) system with asymmetric user-end keying algorithm. 

provides a trustworthy access control mechanism by using CIPERTEXT-POLICY ATTRIBUTE-BASED ENCRYPTION (CP-ABE) in order to achieve secured EHR sharing between the patients and the health care providers including hospitals and pharmacists.
Patient can register and feed his details regarding health which then will be converted into a hash value using SHA 256 algorithm, and then it will be embedded into EHR Data. Using this hash value the doctor and the hospital can view the details permitted by the patients.
